# Contraction Hierarchies

This repository contains a Rust implementation of [Contraction Hierarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies) a speed-up technique for finding the shortest path in a graph.
The project is part of the [Algorithm Engineering Lab - Route Planning](https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/teaching/winter2023/algorithmengineeringpraktikum/index) at ITI Karlruher Institute of Technology.
In a preprocessing step, shortcuts that skip over "unimportant" nodes are computed based on a node ordering.
The shortest path can be computed using a bidirectional Dijkstra search in the augmented graph that only follows edges upward in the node hiearchy.
Contraction Hierarchies leverage the fact that road networks tend to be highly hierarchical.
